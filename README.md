1. Task Management
Add Task:
Implement a feature to add tasks in each section.
Tasks should have dynamic name and description.
Other details can be hardcoded for simplicity.
Move Tasks:
Implement the functionality to move tasks from one section to another (e.g., dragging a task from "To Do" to "In Progress").
2. Filtering
Task Filtering:
Implement a filtering feature that allows users to filter tasks based on certain criteria.
You can choose the criteria (e.g., task category, due date, priority).
3. State Management
Redux:
Use Redux to manage the state of the application.
Ensure the application state is persistent using Local Storage. This means that tasks and their states should remain intact even after a page refresh.
